Remove list selector.

The "list trim" object inputs lists (or makes lists out of incoming non-list messages) and outputs a message whose selector is the first item of the list, and whose arguments, if any, are the remainder of the list. If the list has no items, or if its first item is numeric, the selector is "list" (which might print out as list, float, or bang.)
