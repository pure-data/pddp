Sometimes it is easier to access the same file-handle from different parts of the patch (e.g. when reading and parsing a file), rather than going backwards and forwards with a single 'file handle' object.

In this case, you can use the 'file define' object to provide a file handle that can then be accessed by multiple 'file handle' objects.
