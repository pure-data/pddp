The samphold~ object samples its left input whenever its right input decreases in value (as a phasor~ does each period, for example.) Both inputs are audio signals.

The "set" message sets the output value (which gets updated normally afterward.) The "reset" message causes samphold~ to act as if the given value were the most recent value of the control (right) input. Use this, for example, if you reset the incoming phasor but don't want the jump reflected in the output as in the example below to the right. Plain "reset" is equivalent to "reset infinity" which forces the next input to be sampled.
