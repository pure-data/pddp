Convert from list of numeric character codes to symbols.

`[list fromsymbol]` and `[list tosymbol]` allow you to do string manipulations (such as scanning a filename for '/' characters). They convert a list of numbers (which might be ASCII or might be unicode if, for example, they represent a filename on a non-ASCII machine) to or from a symbol.
