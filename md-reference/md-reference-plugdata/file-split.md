This objects perform common string operations on filenames. no checks are performed verifying the validity/existence of any path-component.

NOTE: 'file split' will always output (lists of) symbols, even if the component looks like a number. on one hand this makes it harder to [route], but on the other hand this will keep zero-padded numbers intact (think "2020/01/01/0042.wav").
