The snapshot~ object takes a signal and converts it to a control value whenever it receives a bang in its left outlet. This object is particularly useful for monitoring outputs.

A 'set' message is provided for the (rare) situations where you might make a known change to the signal input, and then read snapshot's value before any ensuing signal computation.
