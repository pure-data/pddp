keyname gives the symbolic name of the key on the right outlet, with a 1 or 0 in the left outlet if it's up or down, and works with non-printing keys like shift or "F1".

Caveat -- this only works if Pd actually gets the key events which can depend on the stacking order of windows and/or the pointer location, depending on the system.
