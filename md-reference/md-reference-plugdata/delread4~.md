Delread4~ implements a 4-point interpolating delay tap. The delay in milliseconds of the tap is specified by an incoming signal for variable delay times.

Delread~ and delread4~ objects read from a delay line allocated in a delwrite~ object with the same name. Note that in this help file we're using delay names with "$0" (the patch ID number used to force locality in Pd). You can use more than one delread~ and/or delread4~ objects for the same delwrite~ object. If the specified delay time in delread~/delread4~ is longer than the size of the delay line or less than zero it is clipped to the length of the delay line.

In case the delwrite~ runs later in the DSP loop than the delread~ or delread4~ objects, the delay is constrained below by one vector length (usually 64 samples).
