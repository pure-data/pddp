pow~ raises a signal to a numeric power (given by another signal or argument/float). The inputs may be positive, zero, or negative.

WARNING: it's easy to generate "infinity" by accident, and if you do, the DSP chain may dramatically slow down if you're using an i386 or ia64 processor. Out-of-range floating point values are thousands of times slower to compute with than in-range ones. There' a protection against NaNs (they become 0).
