"Value" stores a numeric value which is shared between all values with the same name (which need not be in the same Pd window.)

The value may also be stored or recalled in expressions via the expr, expr~, and fexpr~ objects.

The value object can also receive float values sent via a [send] object or a message if it has a variable with the same name.
