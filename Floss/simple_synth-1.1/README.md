Quick note: The files added in the `initial commit` are all the original files from the authors of the Pure Data FLOSS manual listed here: https://en.flossmanuals.net/pure-data/_full/#credits. Note, the documentation is listed as a GPL v2 license, but it doesn't clearly communicate anything about the source code that originally came with the documentation. I'm hoping that's the case with the code as well.

It appears that the full simple_synth zip file that came with the manual has been lost. I've searched around various locations, only able to find the following two links: 

- https://cs.au.dk/~ocaprani/legolab/Sandsynlighedsregning/PureData/sinus.html
- https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/5324/simple-synth-aka-the-minimoog/2

I've also contacted Mick from the FLOSS site and he's informed me that the files do appear to be lost. While I'm learning Pure Data, I figured I'd work to recreate the missing files and have started to add these to this repo. Mick just added the `.dk` file above as `incomplete` to the FLOSS manual at https://en.flossmanuals.net/pure-data/_full/#simple-synth and will update with the full copy of files from this repo when I'm done.

If you have any issues with any of this, please submit an issue or a pull request and I'll be happy to provide input.

Thank you!
