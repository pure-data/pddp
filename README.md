###   About



This is just a page/repository under https://github.com/pure-data to discuss all things related to Pure Data's documention, including help files, manual and also online resources such as puredata.info.

The .md files in this repository is part of a project/idea to use them for an online Pd help website, a draft is in https://lucarda.github.io/pandoc-and-reference/ but this is not really taking off if you know what I mean...

See https://github.com/pure-data/pddp/issues and https://github.com/pure-data/pddp/discussions/ or open issues/discussions yourself if you want to collaborate. 

Documentation changes regarding contents of https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data (manual/help files) should be made via a PR to the https://github.com/porres/pure-data/tree/Documentation branch.
